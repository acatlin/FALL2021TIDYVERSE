# Introduction

**Lubridate** is an R package that simplifies the handling of date and time data, one of the most common problems in data transformation.

[**Lubridate CheatSheet**](https://rawgit.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/lubridate.pdf)


## Loading the package
While part of the **tidyverse**, Lubridate does not load by default using the **library(tidyverse)** command.  Instead, load it separately:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Introducting date-times
A date-time is a data object representing a point on the timeline, typically to the nearest second, with notation as to the timezone represented.

For example, to get the current date use **today()**; for the current date-time, use **now()**:

```{r}
today() # returns a date only
now() # returns a date-time
```

# Functions

For this exercise, we'll use an excerpt of a Netflix dataset with date added per title.
```{r}
data <- ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jefedigital/cuny-data-607/main/data/netflix_titles.csv')

df <- read.csv(data) %>%
  select(title, date_added)
```

## Parsing datetimes
Lubridate simplifies the parsing of strings and date-time objects and components into a uniform date-time format.

If we inspect the **date_added** field in the Netflix dataset, we notice these are character strings with long-form months spelled out. We'll want to convert these into actual date-time objects.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(df,5)
```

To parse a given string to date-time, pass it to a function named for the order of the year (y), month (m), day (d), hour (h), minute (m) and second (s) elements in your data.
```{r}
mdy('September 1, 2020')
```

We can use the **mdy** function to create a new column with **date_added** in date-time format:
```{r}
df <- df %>% mutate(date_added_dt = mdy(date_added))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(df,5)
```

## Rounding Datetimes
Sometimes we want to round off date-time objects to the nearest unit of time (such as day, month or year.) 

Lubridate provides three functions: **round_date** to round to the nearest unit,  **floor_date** to round down, and **ceiling_date** to round up.

As an example, let's round our new **date_added_dt** field down to the nearest month:

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(date_added_mon = floor_date(date_added_dt, unit='month'))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(df,5)
```
